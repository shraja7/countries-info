# Country Information Viewer

This project is a simple application that allows users to view information about different countries using the REST API provided by [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/). The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can search for a specific country and retrieve relevant information.

## Features

- **Search**: Users can enter a search query into the search field to find information about a specific country.
- **Display**: The application retrieves and displays various information about the country, such as its name, capital, population, area, languages spoken, and more.
- **Filtering**: If the search query matches more than 10 countries, the user is prompted to make their query more specific. This helps narrow down the search results for better accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend user interface.
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend server.
- Axios for making HTTP requests to the REST API.
