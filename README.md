# Country Information Viewer

This project is a simple application that allows users to view information about different countries using the REST API provided by [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/). The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can search for a specific country and retrieve relevant information.

## Features

- **Search**: Users can enter a search query into the search field to find information about a specific country.
- **Display**: The application retrieves and displays various information about the country, such as its name, capital, population, area, languages spoken, and more.
- **Filtering**: If the search query matches more than 10 countries, the user is prompted to make their query more specific. This helps narrow down the search results for better accuracy.
- **Click to Get More Info**: Users can click on a country name to view more detailed information about that country.
- **Clear Button**: Users can click on the "Clear search" button to clear the search field.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend user interface.
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend server.
- Axios for making HTTP requests to the REST API.
- React.js for building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
- `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects in React.
- CSS for styling the user interface and creating a responsive design.
- Git for version control and collaboration.

## Usage

- Enter a search query in the search field to find information about a specific country.
- Click on a country name in the search results to view more detailed information about that country.
- To clear the search field, click on the "Clear search" button.

## Future Enhancements

- Add pagination to the search results if there are more than 10 countries matching the query.
- Implement caching of API responses to improve performance and reduce unnecessary requests.
- Add additional information and data visualization for each country, such as currency, time zone, and geographical data.
- Improve the user interface with more intuitive interactions and responsive design.
- Add weather data
